Speed Trainer Metronome

I've made a tool useful to training speed of various musical exercises.

Might be used as regular metrononome, but the full potential lies in ability to speed up after certain amount of time or bars.

Can be used to train odd rhythms (indian classical/arabic/turkish/balkan/folk music etc)

It has ability to store user presets in cookies.

It's work in progress still so it has just two basic instruments.
