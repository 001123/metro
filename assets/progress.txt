*******************************************
*********  CURRENT TASK  ******************
*******************************************

- make 'silent' mode for excercising rhytm accuracy
- use firebase db to store presets

ISSUES:

when time passed it jumps to new part without waiting last one to end

- editInPlace

*******************************************
*********     TODO       ******************
*******************************************

- issue when we change time signature (beats per step) and then change to BY_BAR, it still has old loop length with previous BPS

- i18n


- geometric bpm change so we can have smaller bpm jumps on higher speeds



DONE:
- improve look
--- small visualisation
--- center button start
--- move Lock button
--- advise that you can click plan to change current bpm
--- instrument label instead of key

- save preset to cookie?
-- modal to save with name
- vis is shit now
- increase speed every to be a slider
- extend slider to include some geo steps and clickable values on top of the ruler

- decide what to do at end of plan (carry on, reverse, stop?)
- load preset -> instrument dropdown not updated
- start by_bar, first plan step doesn't update progress
- support removing own presets
- accenty przyciski zrobic na 3 kwadraciki
- save preset doesn't store instrument
- kolorki na vis zeby sie zgadzaly z akcentami
- moze sie da transport uprroscic cos zeby np playback/repeat  hmmmm'
- spacja start stop
rhytm trainer to mute for x bars
- ten roz razi, za duzo go 
- planner musi miec pause i play

*********  BUGS          ******************
*******************************************


V1:
 
- cycki dla gooziego

- exercise progress bar
- encapsulate all timing thing into planner and just execute setBpmchange in App on planner events
- ui is clunky still. segment duration doesn't interact well with 'Measures per bar' etc
- refactor SoundMachine to get array of instruments from App so we know what to display in dropdown etc
- lock speed button


- Total time to show minutes, so AdvancedSlider need custom renderer
- constant in cycle BEATS vs NUMBER OF STEPS-
- one time, loopback, repeat on cycles, means we should stop once plan is finished generally
- various plan renderers (ie. graph)
- editInPlace for settings
- keyboard control


v2:
- theme select ?
- fullscreen when playing
- tanpura
- simple drum machine instead of beats
- accent volume


DONE:
- plan to be clickable, so we can advance our excercise at any time

- calc total plan time
- 3 akcenty
|-	onMeasureChange update part to reflect changes instead of recreating part
- 	Tone.Part instead of schedule
- when  exercise time has been changed the sound doesn't speed up 
- control to display current measure and maybe to select where to use accents
- Slider to control measures per bar [3 - 12]
- onSliderDrag update
- js sound generate
- start stop btn
- play mp3 instead of tone	
- sound schedule
- UI to set startbpm, endbpm, part duration
- speed alteration module
- instrument change


-  App.js:306 Uncaught TypeError: this.refs.sm.setTransport is not a function
    at App.onAccentsChange (App.js:306)
    at onAfterChange (App.js:165)
    at HTMLUnknownElement.call- initialization is incorrect. After page loaded click START (planner doesn't show up	)
- change segment duration during play, the actual plan won't update and will play old schedule- play and stop but the timers will still execute- TODO convert timers = [] to single timer as we're just waiting till next step
- when changing accents don't restart the machine (interesting)
- measuresPerBar dynamic (to not stop the current playback)
- instrument selection (drums, clicks, synth, tabla)
-  TODO  event handling between Planner and SoundMachine so they stay in sync
- constant STEPS
- layout it a bit
